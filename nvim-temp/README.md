# Modular Neovim Configs from the kickstarter

## The project structure

it all started from init.lua and calls every other .lua files to load the plugins, options, and keymaps

it is pretty straight forward, everything about plugins, keymaps, etc that I need to know is located in the [lua folder](/lua/)

## Wishes

I hope I can grow this thing bigger. Amen. 🙏.
