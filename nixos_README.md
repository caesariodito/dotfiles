am back to nixos, and currently feeling pretty comfortable with the setup that I made and the way I designed my modular system for the nixos config. Although I know there were some redundancy in the setup config, but I will continuously work on that.

maybe I should map out how my configs work. I learned a lot from chatgpt, tho its not 100% reliable. I still need to surf the web, search forums, and making everything sense to me, since I have 0 knowledge about this.

I think I can take the theory pretty well, but the implementation is a bit hard ... but by getting wet on my feet with these madness, it only costs two days ðŸ’€ to got into this point (where I am pretty confident with what I made, tho not fully understand yet).

oya, btw about the downside of nix, the double syntax that you need to learn, it is kinda true and annoying ... currently still looking forward to go back to my arch setup. but nixos is soooo flexible, I can just try everything with seconds! no need to manage conflicting packages or outdated ones, i just need to type `nix shell nixpkgs#lazygit` if you want to try out lazygit. and ofc, if you want to try out new DE or like hyprland, you just need to modify the config, and if everything bad happens, you can just rollback to the previous state of the os. pretty cool.

btw kde plasma is pretty neat.

that's all peace out.
